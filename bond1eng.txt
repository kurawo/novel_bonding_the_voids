# Guilty Crown Bonding the Voids

Ten years have passed since the Apocalypse Virus pandemic suddenly broke out in Tokyo. Under the watchful eye of GHQ, Japan is recovering from the disaster and is in the "Void Bubble," a bubble of psychological measurement technology called "Void Technology" that coefficients the mind. Shu Ouma, a high school student interning at Sephiragenomics, the company directly under the control of GHQ that is leading the psychological measurement technology 《Void Technology》, denies the Power of the King, the technology created by his dead father to create weapons based on the mind, and to divert the attention of the company and the public, he starts a completely different research and development project under the name of "clown".
 To divert the attention of the corporation and the public, he has been conducting completely different research and development both inside and outside the corporation under the handle "clown". But one day, in an abandoned high school building, he meets Inori Yuzuriha, a terrorist who wants to liberate Japan with her psychological measurement technology, Void Technology. She is wounded and has been stealing drugs for Power of the King, which was created by Sephiragenomics, despite Shu's intentions. Shu takes Inori directly to the terrorist home to try to get them to give up Power of the King...  
The battle to connect all of guilts that he has deemed meaningless begins now.



## epigraph

Even atop the dining table, someone's story lives on.
This world is an aggregate of such modest stories.

## prologue

　LET ME TELL you a story about leading up to that day.  
　I'll tell you about the day I connected all Guilts.  
　And to the day when the world you see now was created.

　I talk about my u.
　The never-ending atonement.
　And about the boy.

　It all started in the spring.
　I was running through a large underground waterway in a place called the 24th district. I was carrying something small but important in my chest.
　I thought of the night view above ground in this 24th district. It was the Megafloat, a huge floating structure in Tokyo Bay that had been rapidly expanded from what was once called Daiba. It is a cluster of lights that looks like multiple layers of skyscrapers. It was also known as the Bone Christmas Tree, because it was built in the wake of an incident in which many people died.
　The tree of wisdom was said to have contained the forbidden fruit that triggered the expulsion from paradise and the original sin. The holy tree, the "Christmas Tree," is a replica of this tree.
　At the top of this large tree, there was no star, the symbol of the Lord who bore all Guilts. It was as if, at some point, the world had lost sight of the Lord.
　While I'm running, I get a transmission.
"Did you get the key? ......
　I say yes.
"Good job, I'll guide you."
　My friend runs in front of me. A small, round, four-legged robot called Auto Insect. The robot guiding me along the way.
　This is how I continue to escape through the roots of the holy tree.
　It was as if I had stolen the forbidden fruit.
　I stare at the forbidden fruit. A specially shaped syringe filled with liquid. The communicator continues.
"If you can get the king's ability with that genome weapon, our redemption will be fulfilled."
"Do you use it?"
"Yeah, I, or someone else, will have to use it"
　I ask.
"Won't it be like when Adam and Eve ate the apple?"
　The other person is silent.
"If we try, might can . But if you don't, we never will."  
　The other person continued.
"If you need anything, go to the designated point at Tennozu High School in Shinagawa. There's a guy who knows what it is. But don't hand it to him. He doesn't deserve it."
　As I run, I open my terminal to check my location and the route from here.
"Who is?"
　He replies in a whisper.
"The guy you loved."
"loved..."
　I didn't understand what he meant by that. However, before I could ask any questions, the communication with the other party was cut off, leaving a voice saying that they would meet up in thirty seconds.
　Putting the terminal away, I climbed up to the catwalk and started running again.
　From one moment to the next, I have no memory of what happened before. I guess that's when it happened. I don't even know what it means to love someone, but I'm sure it was too much for me.
　But then I remembered. I remembered the boy I met in my dream.
　the one who was always crying and hesitant to take the ayatori.
　The sound of a motor running echoed through the underground sewers, and I came to my senses.
　There was something that looked like a blue tank chasing me at high speed.
　It was a weapon called the Endlave, which had been put to practical use at some point.
　Then, with a further driving sound, something was released at high speed. When I came to, I was blown away. By the time I realized that I had fallen, blood was already flowing from one arm.
　Moaning, I stared at the syringe. It hadn't been broken.
　Standing up, I activated the optical camouflage attached to my clothes and continued to run away, blending into the surrounding scenery. But the trail of blood was still there.


　I eventually made my way through the underground waterways and reached the bridge that connects the 24th district to Tokyo.
　I called my friend and bent down to meet him.
I called my friend and bent down to him, "Please, Fyunell, take this to ......."
　I opened the auto-insect's body and pushed the syringe in.
　I heard that driving sound again. I realized that something had been shot. I hold Fyunell protectively in my arms. Then there was an explosion nearby. I understood in a daze through the ringing in my ears that we were being shelled. When I turned my attention to the enemy, the tank was getting closer.
　But then something hit the void. The tank was gently transforming into a human shape, pushing against something. From the void, a large doll of a different shape eventually emerges.
　It's an ally, I realize.
"I'll cover you, you get it to life!"
　I call out to Fuener, and we start running.
　Will we be able to escape with this?
　Just then, I heard a sound that seemed to rip through the sky.
"Dammit!"
　Just as I thought I heard the voice, an explosion occurred behind me. With the third shot, Fyunell and I were both blown off the bridge.
　The bridge fades away.
　I'm falling into the lonely sea.



### 1

　The stars are disappearing as a slight glow of red enters the sky.

　The ruined buildings are covered with icy crystals glowing in red. The dirty ground was also covered with crystals, like wildflowers.  
　Out of nowhere, I hear someone singing in that place. It was peaceful and beautiful.  
　I proceed through the ruins of the illusion. As if guided by that voice. I reached the base of a hill and stopped.  
　At the top of the hill, I saw a girl with cherry blossom-colored hair. She was wearing a vermilion robe like a heavenly maiden, sitting on a crystalline throne and singing. Around her, crystals were blooming like wildflowers. Like the song, the girl herself was as beautiful as a finely crafted doll, further accentuating the lack of reality.  
　With a gentle gaze, she gently touched the crystals sitting there. The crystals shine even brighter in response. She looks at it and smiles. I walk up the hill toward her smile.  
　When I reach the girl, I gaze into her blue eyes and speak softly to her.  
"Look behind you, at those poor souls who have lost their place and are still here." 
　I look back. Many people are staring at us, smiling quietly at me. But their bodies were slightly translucent. Like a ghost.  
　And then I realize.  
"They're all dead, aren't they?"  
　I say and turn back to the girl. The girl smiles gently again.
"Yes, and so are you."  
　I look around at my body. I look around my body and spread my left hand, the most prominent one. It was transparent. For the first time, I realize that I am one of them.  
　I hear a voice from somewhere, and I stare at the horizon, with the girl's figure beside me. Beyond the girl's figure, I stare, where many people have arrived. It was as if they were aiming for the place where the girl and I were.  
　Is this the alternate world that after death? I ask the girl. The girl sitting on the crystal shakes her head.  Her gesture gives me a sense of nostalgia.  
"No, this is the usual world. This is the world that you and I have lived in. the world that is connected to our lives, the world that we have always known."  
　Okay, I say.  
　I was so sad that I burst into tears.  
　Among the people coming from the horizon, there were people I didn't know well. My father, who had disappeared during the catastrophe. My mother, who disappeared after giving birth to me. The drug addicts I had a hand in designing. All these people I knew were dead, or I had killed them.  
“Are They all ghosts?"  
　The girl smiles again. The girl smiled again, her face kind and compassionate.  
"Yes, because if you don't become a ghost and live inside someone else, there will never create heaven here.  
　In her hands, I suddenly realized that she had an Ayatori. The shape of a bridge. And she holds it out to me. It, too, looked familiar to me.  
"Take it..."  
　I reach out my hand. I reach out my hand, but she eventually drops it.  
　She smiles, but tilts her head.  
　Because for me, that was the most terrifying thing of all.
